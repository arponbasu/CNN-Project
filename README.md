This repository contains my first ever exposure to machine learning, the theory aspects of which I covered through Andrew Ng's course on Coursera, and the coding assignments of which
were given by my SoC mentors. This repository thus contains basic implementations of linear and logistic regressions, as well as some very common image processing operations
such as cropping, Gaussian blurring, vectorizing, etc.
